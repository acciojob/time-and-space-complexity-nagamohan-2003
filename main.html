    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. We often want to find a time efficient algorithm that solves a given problem.</p>

    <p>The amount of memory space required to run an algorithm is known as <b>Space Complexity</b>. It is typically expressed using Big O notation, for example, O(n).</p>
